Module 5 Challenge on Data Visualization

In this challenge, I am a senior data scientist working at a company called Pymaceuticals, Inc., which develops medications targeting cancer. I have been given access to data from a clinical study, in which a variety of cancer treatments are bieng tested on mice. The purpose of this study is to compare the cancer treatments from other companies against Pymaceuticals' cancer medication called Capomulin. As the senior data scientist, I am responsible for creating tables, charts, and graphs on the clinical study data.
